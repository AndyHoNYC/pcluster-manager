Deploy Pcluster Manager","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The AWS ParallelCluster API has been released with the version 3 of AWS ParallelCluster. It enables you to to manage clusters though an API hosted on AWS and build workflows to manage your cluster lifecycle with Python.\nPcluster Manager is a web UI that built upon the AWS ParallelCluster CLI that you can use to manage your compute clusters. It\u0026rsquo;ll take about 20 minutes to deploy both stacks. You will initiate the deployment now to have it ready by the time you need it.\n Deploy the Pcluster Manager stack by clicking on the link in your region.

Scroll down to the bottom of the Stage 4 page (Review) and click on the the two tick boxes to create new IAM resources. Once done, click on Create stack.  The stack is deploying using AWS CloudFormation. It will take ~20 minutes to deploy the AWS ParallelCluster API and Pcluster Manager GUI. In the meantime, you will complete the first part of the lab.
